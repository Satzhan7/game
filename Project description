# Tower Blocks game

Game was developed using the Pygame library in Python. Main idea of the game is to stack as many blocks as possible on top of each other without letting any block fall off the screen.

## How to Play

- Use the space bar to drop a block onto the tower at the bottom.
- If the block lands on the tower in the allowed range, the tower height increases, and player's score will increase also.
- If the block lands outside the allowed range, it will be counted as miss and the player receives a miss point.
- If the player earns 10 points, they win the game. If the player receives 3 miss points, they lose the game.

## Dependencies
